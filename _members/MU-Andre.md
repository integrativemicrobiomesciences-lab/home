Andre Mu is a Senior Lecturer and Laboratory Head with the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Monash University, and is affiliated with the Biomedicine Discovery Institute’s *Infection*, and *Metabolism, diabetes & obesity* Programs. 

Andre’s current research focus informs gut microbiome engineering strategies towards translating observations from the bench to human-relevant therapeutic applications using integrative microbiome sciences. 

Andre has over 14 years of training across four world-leading institutions spanning three continents, including<br/>
[*Sanger Institute*](https://www.sanger.ac.uk) (UK),<br/>
[*EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute*](https://www.ebi.ac.uk) (UK),<br/>
[*Salk Institute for Biological Studies*](https://www.salk.edu) (USA), and the<br/>
[*Doherty Institute*](https://www.doherty.edu.au) (Australia) – each position supported by prestigious individual research fellowships, totalling >$411,000. 

Andre has trained with world-leaders in microbiology and microbiome sciences, including<br/>
[Prof. Janelle S. Ayres](https://www.salk.edu/scientist/janelle-ayres/) (Salk),<br/>
[Prof. Rob Knight](https://knightlab.ucsd.edu/wordpress/?page_id=47) (UCSD),<br/>
[Dr. Trevor D. Lawley](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/person/lawley-trevor/) (Sanger),<br/>
[Prof. Timothy P. Stinear](https://www.doherty.edu.au/people/tim-stinear) (UniMelb), and<br/>
[Prof. Richard A. Strugnell](https://www.doherty.edu.au/people/professor-richard-dick-strugnell) (UniMelb).<br/>
His graduate research at the University of Melbourne with [Assoc. Prof., John Moreau](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/ges/staff/johnmoreau/) (UGlasgow) was in environmental sciences elucidating the interactions of a 1.5-km deep subsurface microbial community using high-throughput sequencing technologies. During this time, Andre was awarded a competitive fellowship through the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to train in anaerobic microbiology with [Prof., Gerrit Voourdouw](https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/gerrit-voordouw) at the University of Calgary. 

Andre has authored 30 publications to date in journals such as Nature Communications, Nature Reviews Microbiology, and Microbiome – all with the common themes of microbiome sciences at the leading-edge of integrating techniques from different disciplines and omic platforms, defining future directions of research.
