# Integrative Microbiome Sciences Laboratory 

We combine the disciplines of microbiome sciences, bioinformatics, and multi-omics (including metaproteomics) in an effort to inform molecular approaches to modulate the functions of the microbiome for desired host health phenotypes. We have particular interests in infectious diseases, and antimicrobial resistance.

Weâ€™re building and training a team of interdisciplinary scientists, including, for example, microbiologists, bioinformaticians, ecologists, and clinicians who are interested in tackling global problems at the interface of infectious diseases, antibiotic resistance, and phage biology, from the vantage point of integrative microbiome sciences.
