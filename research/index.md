## What we do
We employ both wet lab and dry lab approaches to answer research questions. We analyse large omic datasets to generate novel targeted hypotheses (discovery science) to validate in the lab, and translate towards advancements in biotherapeutic and biotechnological applications. 

## How we do it
Our lab has expertise in microbial genomics (isolates and microbiomes), integrative multi-omics, and *in vitro* molecular microbiology techniques.<br/> 
A key component of our lab's success is through open and collaborative science. We therefore work closely with world-leading researchers from Monash University, and with colleagues at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, University of California San Diego, Wellcome Sanger Institute, and Rutgers Health New Jersey Medical School, to address global research challenges of mitigating infectious diseases, antimicrobial resistance, and understanding the links across microbiomes and human health. 

## What are we working on
Below are highlights of some current research topics in our lab.<br/>
**We would love to hear from highly-motivated prospective graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars interested in related areas to identify and develop key questions to pursue in their research project.** Applicants must submit a concise research proposal (1 - 2 pages written) that aligns with the lab's establshed topics to ensure appropriate support and mentoring can be provided. 

### Microbial ecology of infectious diseases
Metabolic hand-off processes,<br/> 
Integrative microbiome sciences<br/>
Bacterial sepsis<br/>
