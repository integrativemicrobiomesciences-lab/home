## What we do
We employ both wet lab and dry lab approaches to answer research questions. We analyse large omic datasets to generate novel targeted hypotheses (discovery science) to test in the lab, and translate towards advancements in biotherapeutic and biotechnological applications. 

## How we do it
A key component of our lab's success is through open and collaborative science. We work closely with world-leading researchers from Monash University, and with colleagues at the University of California San Diego, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, Wellcome Sanger Institute, and Rutgers Health New Jersey Medical School. 

## What are we working on
Below are some highlights of current research projects.<br/>
**We would love to hear from prospective graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and collaborators interested in related areas to identify .**  


### Microbial ecology of infectious diseases<br/>
Metabolic hand-off processes,<br/> 
Integrative microbiome sciences<br/>
